# Objects
-   Functions and Objects are relatable.
-   everything is an object. __proto__ down to the core is null
-   mixins by Object.assign
-   setPrototype sets the heirarchy for Object
-   arguments can be used to fetch argument  - is an object
-   new Object
    -   Creates new plain object
    -   Checks its own prototype property and add it to the prototype of newly created object
    -   execute the constructor with this which is done by (the argument and apply function is used on the Object)
    -   return the object
-   proto is the reference to the object
-   prototype only exists on function and not on objects
    -   prototype is only available on function so that we can refer using new 
-   Object is a function too internally so try Object() and new Object() should be same.
-   Object.create is a static method
    -   Object.create is more natural to the protoye model than new Class
    -   don't use setPrototype of object (only for tutorials)
    -   Object.create in conjuction with init
-   Class
    -   extends and super()
    -   private don't exist
    -   _ as a suggest that don't change it
