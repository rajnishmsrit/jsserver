# Basics
-   literals vs value
-   Number
-   Coercion - Implicit/Explicit
-   Javascript is a multi-paradigm language
-   Backwards compatibility is key to the language
-   The idea is that JS developers can write code with confidence
that their code wonâ€™t stop working unpredictably because a
browser update is released.
-   JS is not forwards-compatible.
-   HTML and CSS, by contrast, are forwards-compatible but not
backwards-compatible.
-   A pragma is a compiler directive.
-   ES6 modules
assume strict mode, so all code in such files is automatically
defaulted to strict mode.
