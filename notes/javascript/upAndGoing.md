# Beginning
-   What is JS?
    -   literals vs value
    -   Number
    -   Coercion - Implicit/Explicit
    -   Javascript is a multi-paradigm language
    -   Backwards compatibility is key to the language
    -   The idea is that JS developers can write code with confidence
    that their code wonâ€™t stop working unpredictably because a
    browser update is released.
    -   JS is not forwards-compatible.
    -   HTML and CSS, by contrast, are forwards-compatible but not
    backwards-compatible.
    -   A pragma is a compiler directive.
    -   ES6 modules
    assume strict mode, so all code in such files is automatically
    defaulted to strict mode.
-   Surveying JS
    -   symbol, which is a special-purpose value that behaves as a hidden unguessable
value. Symbols are almost exclusively used as special keys on
objects
    -   typeof null showing as Object is a historical blunder in JS, can't be fixed.
