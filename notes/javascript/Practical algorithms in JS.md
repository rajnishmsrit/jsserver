// lodash // array, objects, strings
// Debouncing is a interface level concept ex - search on mobile or web, autosave feature,
// eliminating double clicks propagation
// type onChange time,
// Onkeystroke and if any more events are available for us
// Throttle - is a recurring network call related reduction of calls
// reduce no of calls by setting intervals
// Scroll movements, mouse movements, window resize
// Lazy Loading
// Scrollability
// Window API
// React scrollability handling library
    // Is it heavy or is it light
    //
// Can I write it without that wrapper library?
    // Yes it is simple, go ahead implement.
// Web APIs
// Local storage // IndexedDB
// Difference b/w window in desktop apps, vs browser vs mobile
