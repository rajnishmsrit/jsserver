# PR points to think
-   Whether the code executes on backend or frontend
    -   web api on backend is a bad idea
-   components should be pure functions
-   Check for memory leaks
-   Check that a event listener is removed after its use.
-   Rendering should be a pure calculation.
-   Rendering, side Effects and synchronized effects are different and should be thought while desigining
-   Need of cleanup function in useEffect
