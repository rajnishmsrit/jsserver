# Revise React
-   Portals
    -   used for Modal and such
-   Synthetic Events
-   Hooks
    -   useMemo
    -   useCallback
    -   useState
    -   useContext
    -   useRef
    -   useLayoutEffect
    -   useEffect
-   Higher Order Components
-   Controlled Component vs Uncontrolled Components
-   Synthetic Events
-   Event handler
-   e event is destroyed after consumption by React. use e.persist()
    -   practice this locally
-   CreatClass and mixins
-   List and keys 
    -   the key id is not available for use, so if you need it please pass as a prop too.
    - thinking about how natively we create diff algorithm
    - why keys are imp to react
-    <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>
    -   why does this arrow function rerenders every time.
-   Forms
    -   Create a naive form without formik
    -   input, select, textarea are made consistent with react even though they are diff on HTML
    -   input type file is uncontrolled,
    -   the goal of react is to use controlled component as much as possible
    -   Controlled Input Null Value experiment on local
    -   find a component library used by good organization and study
    -   State Updates May Be Asynchronous
        -   read again and try locally
    -   There should be a single “source of truth” for any data that changes in a React application.
    -   Composition over Inheritance
        -   Containment
            -   how to create FancyBorder with inheritance
    -   Thinking in React needs to be done with an example
